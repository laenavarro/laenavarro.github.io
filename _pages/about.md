I am a conservation biologist at the [Do√±ana Biological Station](https://ebd.csic.es) of the Spanish Research Council (EBD-CSIC). 

My goal is to understand the patterns and processes of biodiversity change while proposing novel approaches to address such change. I am particularly interested in how biodiversity responds to human activities (or a lack thereof) and how this knowledge can support effective conservation policies. 

My research is interdisciplinary by nature and I enjoy integrating disciplines such as theoretical, spatial, and quantitative ecology, with geography and social sciences. The approaches that I use for this purpose range from modelling and statistical analysis to systematic reviews. 

Concretely, my research is organized around three interconnected lines of investigation:

* <b>Understanding the patterns and processes of biodiversity change across scales</b>, from historical changes within the SUMHAL project, to more recent within the PATHWAYS and sChange projects, or even looking into the future. 
* <b>Ambitious approaches to restoration and conservation</b>, initially focusing on rewilding European landscapes and more recently looking at improving the integrity and connectivity of protected areas within the NaturaConnect project.
* <b>Biodiversity monitoring and knowledge that can effectively support conservation policies</b>, building up on my work coordinating the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network between 2016 and 2020.
